# HedgeVoiceMapper

A little tool I wrote back in 2013.

Helps you building custom voice packages, from single OGG-files, for [Hedgewars](http://www.hedgewars.org/).

Perhaps someone can make use of it.

## Running the applicatioon
You need to hava Java installed.
The `dist`-folder contains a ready to run JAR-File. Execute the JAR-File by double clicking it or use one of the run-scripts located there. Alternatively you could navigate to the folder using the commandline and then start the JAR by typing `java -jar HedgeVoiceMapper.jar`
